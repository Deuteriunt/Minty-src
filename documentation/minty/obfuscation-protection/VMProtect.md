Minty uses VMProtect, the same packer that Genshin Impact uses. This is to make it a bit harder to reverse engineer. In the past, we used xorstr, but xorstr was causing crashes.

Because we have no way to ever afford VMProtect, we use a cracked version. Ask Colleiflower, azzu, or anyone else with the cracked exe for it if you need it.
