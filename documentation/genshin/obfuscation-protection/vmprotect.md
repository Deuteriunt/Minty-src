VMProtect is a commercially available software packer used by Genshin Impact. You can read more about it at https://vmpsoft.com/. Do note that VMProtect greatly exaggerates their claims of how well it works - many of its features are not unique to its application. Virtualization, mutation, watermarking, control flow flattening, anti-debugging, and so on are well-known (and frequently bypassed) methods of software protection.

The source code for VMProtect was leaked a while ago. If you want to study it, see https://web.archive.org/web/20230512154102/https://github.com/Alukym/VMProtect-Source (note that the repo appears to have been deleted by its creator).
